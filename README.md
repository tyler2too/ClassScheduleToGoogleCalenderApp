UIUC class schedule to Google Calender
- I identified a personal problem: the time-consuming task of manually entering class schedules into Google Calendar. To solve this, I created a website that allows users to copy and paste their class schedules directly, streamlining the process of adding classes to Google Calendar.


Things to do

- Need to fix when there is online and inperson class (priority)
- Update aesthetics? (maybe)
- Improve quality of life (eh)
- Automate the start and end dates?
