I have no internship so might as well make a personal project.
I looked from problems to solve and one of them was the manully inputting of class schedules.
I have always manually entered class schedules into google calender and I want to be able to copy and paste.
So I created this.


Things to do

- Update asethetics? (maybe)
- Improve quality of life (eh)
