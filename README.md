-I have no internship so might as well make a personal project.
-I looked from problems to solve and one of them was the time commitment of manually inputting of class schedules.
-I have always manually entered class schedules into google calendar and I want to be able to copy and paste.
So I created this.


Things to do

- Update aesthetics? (maybe)
- Improve quality of life (eh)
